Updating grub file's parameters worked for me.

First backup original grub file.

	sudo cp -n /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.orig
If for some reason you want to revert to original settings, just run command below in terminal:

sudo mv /etc/default/grub.orig /etc/default/grub && sudo update-grub
Now edit the grub file

	sudo nano /etc/default/grub
Comment the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash”, by adding # at the beginning, which will disable the Ubuntu purple screen.
Change GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=”" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=”text”, this makes Ubuntu boot directly into Text Mode.
Uncomment this line #GRUB_TERMINAL=console, by removing the # at the beginning, this makes Grub Menu into real black & white Text Mode (without background image)
Finally run grub update and restart the system. Next time it will come up with terminal mode.

	sudo update-grub
